## How it works

There are two repositories [`contents`](https://github.com/gignac-cha/my-algorithm-problem-solutions-contents) and [`comments`](https://github.com/gignac-cha/my-algorithm-problem-solutions-comments).

* Content: https://github.com/gignac-cha/my-algorithm-problem-solutions-contents
* Comment: https://github.com/gignac-cha/my-algorithm-problem-solutions-comments

Using [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents) for fetching the repository contents from above repositories.
